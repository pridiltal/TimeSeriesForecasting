## Stochastic processes

"A statistical phenomenon that evolves in time according to probabilistic laws is called a stochastic process." (Box, George EP, et al. Time series analysis: forecasting and control.)

##  Non-deterministic time series or statistical time series

A sample realization from an infinite population of time series that could have been generated by a stochastic process.

## Probabilistic time series model 

Let $\{X_1, X_2, ...\}$ be a sequence of random variables. Then the joint distribution of the random vector $[X_1, X_2, ..., X_n]'$ is 

$$P[X_1 \le x_1, X_2 \le x_2, ..., X_n \le x_n]$$
 

where $-\infty < x_1, ..., x_n < \infty$ and $n = 1, 2, ...$

# Simple time series models

## 1. iid noise

1. no trend or seasonal component

2. observations are independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables with zero mean. 

3. plays an important role as a building block for more complicated time series.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$P[X_1 \le x_1, X_2 \le x_2, ..., X_n \le x_n] = P[X_1 \le x_1]....P[X_n \le x_n].$$
--
Let $F_X(.)$ be the cumulative distribution function of each of the identically distributed random variables $X_1, X_2, ...$ Then, 
$$P[X_1 \le x_1, X_2 \le x_2, ..., X_n \le x_n] = F_X(x_1)...F_X(x_n)$$
--
There is no dependence between observations. Hence,
$$P[X_{n+h} \le x|X_1=x_1, ..., X_n=x_n] = P[X_{n+h} \le x].$$
