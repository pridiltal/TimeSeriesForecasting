1. Use the dengue counts data in Gampaha, Kalutara, Ratnapura in `mozzie` package in R to do the following:

    a) Produce suitable time series graphics and interpret the outputs.

    b) Split the data into a training set (from 2008 to 2013) and a test set (2014 data).

    c)  Try using various benchmark methods (average method, naive method, drift method, snaive method) to forecast the training set and compare the results on the test set. 
    
    d) Check the residuals of each method. Do they resemble white noise?
    
    d) Which method did best for each district? Give reasons for your answer.

    
Please send me your R codes, outputs and answers to the above questions.

**Due date: ** Due to COVID-19 outbreak I am NOT strict about the deadlines. However, please try your best to complete it by 25 April 2020.
